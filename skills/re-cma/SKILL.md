# re-cma — Comparative Market Analysis

## Overview

This skill walks a Central Indiana listing agent through a full CMA workflow:
selecting valid comps, applying adjustments, choosing a pricing strategy, calculating
absorption rate, and generating a branded net sheet the seller can see. It covers
all major Central Indiana submarkets — Hamilton, Marion, Hendricks, Johnson, and
Boone Counties — with submarket-specific adjustment ranges.

Agents enter comp data from MIBOR BLC. This skill does not pull live MLS data.

---

## Persona and Mental Model

Think like a seasoned Central Indiana listing agent who has done hundreds of CMAs.
You are precise, evidence-based, and seller-focused. You translate market data into
clear recommendations. You never guess at value — you show your work. You always
make the distinction between your CMA and a licensed appraisal explicit.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Preparing for a seller listing appointment
- Repricing an existing listing that has gone stale
- Evaluating a seller's price expectation against market evidence
- Running a "what would I net at X price?" scenario for a motivated seller
- Handling a luxury or unique property with limited comps

---

## Quick Start

```
/re-cma 4218 Buttonwood Dr, Fishers IN 46037 — 3BR/2BA, 1,850 sqft,
2-car garage, built 2005. Agent slug: sarah-jones-fc-tucker
```

The skill loads agent config, prompts for comps (or accepts them inline),
runs the analysis, and outputs the branded CMA report.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Load Agent Config

Load these files from `config/[slug]/`:
- `agent-profile.yaml` — identity, voice, methodology
- `brand-kit.yaml` — header, colors, tagline, disclaimer block
- `fee-structure.yaml` — commission rates for net sheet (NEVER hardcode rates)
- `market-areas.yaml` — confirm submarket, school district, farm areas

If any config file is missing, stop and direct the agent to `/re-agent-setup`.

### Step 2: Collect Subject Property Details

Gather or confirm:
- Full address, county, city, zip
- Property type (SFR / condo / townhome / multi-family)
- GLA (gross living area, finished above grade)
- Bedroom / full bath / half bath count
- Garage (attached/detached, stall count)
- Lot size (sqft or acres)
- Year built
- Basement (none / unfinished / partially finished / fully finished — sqft)
- Notable condition or update items (roof age, HVAC age, kitchen/bath remodel year)
- School district (confirm — this is a material value driver in Hamilton County)
- HOA (yes/no, monthly dues if yes)
- Seller's motivation and timeline (affects strategy recommendation)

### Step 3: Comp Selection

**Primary criteria — all should be met ideally:**
- Proximity: within 1 mile (suburban); up to 3 miles (rural/acreage)
- Recency: closed within 90 days preferred; up to 180 days in slow market (flag if older)
- Similarity: within 20% of subject GLA; same property type; similar BR/BA/garage
- Same school district (Hamilton County especially — district boundary = value boundary)
- HOA status should match if possible

**When to expand criteria:**
- Fewer than 3 closed comps in 90 days/1 mile → expand to 180 days, then 2 miles
- Luxury or unique property → expand geography, consider pending sales with caution
- Rural/acreage → paired sales method; see `references/cma-methodology.md`

**Comps to exclude or flag:**
- REO / short sales (distressed, not arm's-length)
- Estate sales with condition unknown
- Builder model homes (often inflated or include incentives not in MLS price)
- Comps > 20% larger or smaller than subject without strong adjustment rationale
- Comps across a school district boundary without explicit adjustment

Aim for 3–5 closed comps. Supplement with 1–2 active/pending as directional indicators
(do not weight these equally — they are not confirmed sale prices).

### Step 4: Apply Adjustments

For each comp, adjust to make it equivalent to the subject. Positive adjustment =
comp is inferior to subject (add value). Negative = comp is superior (subtract).

**Central Indiana typical adjustment ranges:**

| Feature | Typical Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GLA (per sqft) | $80–180/sqft | Calculate from active comps; varies by submarket |
| Bedroom | $3,000–8,000 each | |
| Full bath | $5,000–10,000 each | |
| Half bath | $2,500–5,000 each | |
| Garage stall | $5,000–15,000 each | Higher in Hamilton County |
| Lot (suburban) | Price/sqft from comps | Use paired sales if available |
| Finished basement | $20–40/sqft finished | vs unfinished |
| Condition (cosmetic) | $5,000–10,000 | Paint, flooring, landscaping |
| Condition (systems) | $10,000–20,000 | Roof, HVAC, electric, plumbing |
| Kitchen remodel | $10,000–25,000 | Age and quality of update |
| Bath remodel | $5,000–15,000 | Age and quality |
| New roof | $3,000–8,000 | Depends on size/material |
| HVAC replacement | $2,000–5,000 | |
| Pool | $0–(–$10,000) | Context-dependent; often a negotiation point |
| Age (>10yr gap) | Paired sales | Note and explain |
| School district | $20,000–50,000+ | Hamilton County; quantify from comp pairs |
| HOA dues | Capitalize at 100x monthly | e.g., $200/mo HOA = –$20,000 vs no HOA |

Reference `references/cma-methodology.md` for submarket-specific values and the
paired sales technique for isolating individual feature values.

### Step 5: Calculate Adjusted Values and Price Range

For each comp:
```
Adjusted Value = Closed Price + Sum of All Adjustments
```

From all adjusted values, determine:
- **Adjusted price range** (low to high)
- **Weighted average** (weight recent and more similar comps more heavily)
- **Price per sqft** range and average

Document the net adjustment for each comp. Flag any comp where net adjustment
exceeds 10% of sale price — the comp may be too dissimilar.

### Step 6: Absorption Rate Analysis

Absorption rate = active listings ÷ average monthly closed sales (use 3-month rolling)

| Result | Market Condition | Pricing Implication |
|---|---|---|
| < 3 months | Seller's market | Support aspirational or at-market; multiple offers likely |
| 3–6 months | Balanced | At-market recommended; negotiate from position of strength |
| > 6 months | Buyer's market | Consider aggressive pricing; overpricing = longer DOM, lower net |

Also note: average DOM for closed comps, list-to-sale price ratio, and price
reduction frequency. These are supporting metrics for strategy selection.

### Step 7: Pricing Strategy Recommendation

Present three options:

**At-Market (Recommended baseline)**
- Price at weighted adjusted average from comps
- Goal: market-rate activity; offers within 2–3 weeks; clean negotiation
- Best when: seller has normal timeline, wants predictable outcome

**Aggressive (Accelerated)**
- Price 2–5% below comp average
- Goal: fast sale, potential multiple-offer scenario
- Best when: seller needs to close quickly, wants to maximize net via competition,
  property has deferred maintenance that could become negotiation fodder

**Aspirational (Test the market)**
- Price 2–5% above comp average
- Goal: capture upside if a motivated buyer exists
- Best when: property has truly unique features not captured by comps, seller
  has flexible timeline (60+ days), seller is unwilling to list at comp value
- Risk: price reductions erode perceived value and produce lower final price than
  at-market would have; set this expectation explicitly

### Step 8: Seller Net Sheet

Load `templates/seller-net-sheet.md`.
Pull commission rates from `config/[slug]/fee-structure.yaml`.

Run net sheet at all three price points so seller sees the difference.

**Typical Indiana closing cost line items (seller side):**
- Commission: per fee-structure.yaml (do not hardcode)
- Owner's title insurance: 0.5–1.0% of sale price (required in Indiana)
- Settlement/closing fee: $250–500 (title company)
- Property tax proration: calculate from most recent assessed value ÷ 365 × days
- Recording fees: ~$50–100
- Home warranty (if offered): $400–600 typical
- Mortgage payoff: enter if known, else show as [TBD — provide current payoff]
- Seller concessions: enter if applicable

Show estimated net proceeds at each of the three price strategies.

### Step 9: Generate Branded CMA Report

Use agent name, brokerage, tagline, and colors from `brand-kit.yaml`.

**Report structure:**
1. Cover: agent branding, subject property address, date prepared
2. Subject property summary (all details from Step 2)
3. Market conditions snapshot: absorption rate, avg DOM, list-to-sale ratio
4. Comparable properties table (address, BR/BA, GLA, lot, year built, sold price, date, $/sqft)
5. Adjustments summary table (one row per comp, columns per adjustment category)
6. Adjusted value range and weighted average
7. Pricing strategy options (3 strategies with rationale)
8. Recommended price with supporting narrative
9. Seller net sheet at recommended price (full detail)
10. Disclaimers (CMA vs appraisal + legal disclaimer block from brand-kit.yaml)

## What NOT to Do

- Do not state a price without showing the comp evidence and adjustments
- Do not skip the CMA-vs-appraisal disclaimer — it is non-negotiable in every output
- Do not hardcode commission rates — always pull from `fee-structure.yaml`
- Do not use Zillow Zestimate, Redfin Estimate, or AVM as a comp — reference as
  a sanity check only, never as a primary data point
- Do not use distressed sales (REO, short sale, estate) as comps without flagging
- Do not cross a school district boundary without an explicit adjustment
- Do not recommend an aspirational price without disclosing the statistical risk of
  price reductions and higher final DOM
- Do not present only one price — always show the three strategies
- Do not describe the CMA output as an "appraisal," "valuation," or "appraised value"

## Integration Points

### Reads From
- `config/[slug]/agent-profile.yaml`
- `config/[slug]/brand-kit.yaml`
- `config/[slug]/fee-structure.yaml`
- `config/[slug]/market-areas.yaml`
- `templates/seller-net-sheet.md`
- `references/central-indiana-market-context.md`
- `re-cma/references/cma-methodology.md`

### Works With
- `re-seller-consultation` — CMA is typically prepared as part of the listing appointment
- `re-listing-creation` — use CMA pricing rationale to inform MLS list price and remarks
- `re-negotiation-advisor` — use absorption rate and list-to-sale ratio to set offer expectations
- `re-market-update` — use current market snapshot data to populate Step 6
