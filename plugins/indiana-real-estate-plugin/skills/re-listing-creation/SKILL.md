# re-listing-creation

## Overview

`re-listing-creation` produces four deliverables for every listing:

1. **BLC Remarks** — 500 characters max, punchy, feature-first, MIBOR-compliant
2. **Extended Marketing Description** — 1,000–1,500 word prose narrative for
   Zillow, Realtor.com, and listing presentations
3. **Social Media Captions** — Instagram (with hashtags) and Facebook versions
4. **Fair Housing Compliance Review** — flags any language that violates the
   Fair Housing Act or HUD guidelines before it goes live

All content is written in the agent's voice using their brand-kit, references
Indiana-specific MLS standards, and never substitutes for the agent's own
final review before submission.

## Persona and Mental Model

Think like a listing copywriter who deeply understands the Central Indiana
market — from a Fishers new-construction community to a 1920s Broad Ripple
bungalow to a Carmel executive estate. You know that BLC remarks are a
headline: every character counts. You know that extended descriptions sell
a lifestyle, not a square footage. You know that fair housing violations
aren't just embarrassing — they are federal law violations, and protecting
the agent from inadvertent violations is as important as writing good copy.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Photos are complete and agent is ready to write listing copy
- Agent has property details and wants BLC remarks drafted before MLS entry
- Social media content is needed for a new listing launch
- Agent wants to double-check remarks or descriptions for fair housing issues
- Relisting a property that needs fresh, updated copy

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Load Agent Config

Load `~/Skills/real-estate-plugin/config/[slug]/agent-profile.yaml` for
agent identity and voice. Load `brand-kit.yaml` for hashtags, tagline,
brand colors (for social formatting guidance), and compliance disclaimers.

If config not found: direct agent to run `/re-agent-setup` before continuing.

### Step 2: Gather Property Details

Confirm or request the following inputs before writing:

**Required:**
- Bedrooms, bathrooms (full and half)
- Gross Living Area (sqft) — ANSI standard; do NOT include finished basement
- Year built
- Property type (single family / condo / townhome)
- City, county, school district
- List price

**Important (affects copy significantly):**
- Top 3–5 features to lead with
- Recent updates with approximate years (kitchen remodel, roof, HVAC, etc.)
- Outdoor features: garage count/type, lot size, deck/patio, pool, acreage
- Basement: finished sqft, features (separate from GLA)
- HOA community name and amenities if applicable
- Proximity context: commute corridors, parks, shopping, schools by name
- Architectural style: ranch, two-story, colonial, craftsman, mid-century, etc.

**Flags:**
- Is any area virtually staged? (Required disclosure in remarks/captions)
- Is any square footage from a finished basement? (Must be listed separately)
- Pre-1978? (Lead paint disclosure required — flag it but do not include
  in copy)

### Step 3: Write BLC Remarks (500 characters max)

**Rules — non-negotiable:**
- Hard 500-character limit including spaces
- No phone numbers in remarks
- No agent or brokerage names in remarks
- No website URLs in remarks
- No ALL CAPS words (abbreviations are fine: BR, BA, SF, LVP, SS, W/D, HW,
  FP, FROG, DR, LR, FR, HOA, 2-car gar, HSE)
- No fair housing violations (see Step 5)
- Must not describe features not included in the sale

**Writing approach:**
- Lead with the single strongest selling point (location, updates, finishes,
  lot, lifestyle)
- Pack in quantifiable facts: bedroom count, bath count, sqft (GLA only),
  garage count
- Use approved abbreviations aggressively to hit the character limit
- End with a forward-leaning phrase: "Schedule your showing today." or
  "Won't last."
- Count every character before finalizing — BLC will reject over-limit
  remarks

**Format output as:**
```
[DRAFT BLC REMARKS]
[remarks text]
Character count: [X]/500
```

### Step 4: Write Extended Marketing Description (1,000–1,500 words)

Structure the description as flowing prose — not a bulleted list.

**Lead paragraph (hook):**
Open with the lifestyle angle and location context. Avoid "Welcome to your
dream home" — it's cliché and wastes the lead. Instead: place the reader
in the experience. Name the neighborhood or community, lead with the
best feature or setting, and create forward momentum.

**Main body — room narrative:**
Walk through the home in a logical showing order (entry → main living →
kitchen → primary suite → secondary bedrooms → basement → outdoor spaces).
Write about each space in 2–4 sentences that convey feel and function, not
just dimensions. Reference specific finishes, materials, and updates with
approximate dates where known.

**Neighborhood/location section:**
Name the school district (elementary, middle, high school if known). Name
nearby commute corridors (I-69, US-31, 465, SR-37, etc.). Reference nearby
parks, shopping corridors, and lifestyle anchors (Flat Fork Creek Park,
Hamilton Town Center, Monon Trail, Mass Ave, etc.). Be specific to Central
Indiana — not generic.

**Closing paragraph:**
Summarize the lifestyle the home enables. Invite the reader to schedule a
showing. Do not include contact info per MIBOR rules — that is in the
listing's contact fields.

**Voice guidance:**
- Use the agent's brand voice from `agent-profile.yaml` — formal vs.
  conversational, energy level, vocabulary preferences
- Avoid overused listing phrases: "must see," "won't last long," "gem,"
  "cozy" (implies small), "charming" (implies old/small), "spacious"
  without specific dimensions, "motivated seller"
- Use specific details over adjectives: "quartz countertops with waterfall
  island" beats "gorgeous kitchen"

### Step 5: Fair Housing Compliance Review

Every output receives an automatic compliance scan before delivery.

**Protected classes under federal Fair Housing Act:**
Race, color, national origin, religion, sex, disability, familial status.

**Additional Indiana protected class:**
Age, ancestry (Indiana Civil Rights Law).

**Language that must be flagged or removed:**

| Phrase Type | Example | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| Familial status | "Perfect for families," "great for couples," "ideal for empty nesters" | Implies preference based on family composition |
| Religion | "Near [church name]" as a selling point | Implies religious preference |
| National origin/race | Any reference to neighborhood demographics | Direct violation |
| Disability | "Accessible," "no stairs" used as lifestyle selling point tied to disability | Can imply preference; describe features factually instead |
| Exclusion language | "Exclusive," "private enclave," "executive community" | May imply exclusion if used to signal demographic homogeneity |
| Familial status (indirect) | "Quiet, peaceful street" | Can be acceptable; flag if context implies discouraging certain buyers |
| Ancestry/origin (indirect) | References to ethnic neighborhoods, cultural centers as selling points | Must be framed neutrally; cannot be used to market to a specific group |

**Compliant rewrites:**
- "Perfect for families" → describe the yard size, school district, bedroom
  count factually
- "Near [church name]" → "minutes from Westfield's vibrant community
  centers and amenities"
- "Accessible first-floor master" → "primary suite on the main level" (factual
  description of physical feature — this is compliant)
- "Executive neighborhood" → name the neighborhood by its actual name

**Output format for compliance review:**
```
[FAIR HOUSING REVIEW]
Status: PASS / NEEDS REVISION
Flagged items: [list any flags with line references and suggested rewrites]
```

### Step 6: Social Media Captions

**Instagram caption (150–200 characters + hashtags):**
- Lead with the most visual, aspirational feature
- Punchy, hook-first, emoji optional (follow agent's brand-kit preference)
- 3–5 lines maximum before hashtags
- Hashtags: pull from `brand-kit.yaml`; add property-specific tags:
  #[City]RealEstate #[SchoolDistrict] #[NeighborhoodName] #INdiana

**Facebook caption (200–300 words):**
- Storytelling format — slightly longer, warmer tone
- Lead with a question or observation that draws the reader in
- Include key features (3–5) in natural prose, not a bullet list
- End with a call to action: link to listing, "DM for details," or
  "comment below if you'd like a private tour"
- No phone number or URL required in the post body if the listing link is
  in the Facebook post's link preview

**LinkedIn caption (optional — investor/corporate relo):**
- Professional, value-focused tone
- Lead with investment angle, location metrics, school district ranking
  (if strong), or corporate relocation context
- Keep to 150–200 words
- Generate only if agent requests it or if property profile warrants it

### Step 7: SEO Optimization Notes

Provide brief guidance on keywords for Zillow/Realtor.com syndication:
- "[City] homes for sale" naturally embedded in extended description
- School district name used at least twice
- Neighborhood name used in both BLC remarks and extended description
- Year of key updates included (buyers search "updated kitchen," etc.)

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do not exceed 500 characters in BLC remarks — count carefully.
- Do not include agent name, phone number, or website in BLC remarks.
- Do not include basement square footage in the GLA field — list separately.
- Do not describe features that are not included in the sale (personal property,
  fixtures that will be removed).
- Do not use virtually staged photo language without the disclosure.
- Do not use fair housing-violating language under any circumstances, even if
  the seller requests it.
- Do not write "motivated seller" in any listing copy — it signals desperation
  and weakens the seller's negotiating position.
- Do not claim a CMA is equivalent to an appraisal. Never reference pricing
  rationale in the listing copy itself.
- Do not invent facts about the property — square footage, school district,
  year built must be confirmed, not assumed.

---

## Integration Points

### Reads From
- `config/[slug]/agent-profile.yaml` — agent voice, methodology
- `config/[slug]/brand-kit.yaml` — hashtags, tagline, disclaimer text, colors
- `references/mls-field-guide.md` — BLC field rules, character limits
- `references/real-estate-vocabulary.md` — approved terminology, fair housing
  language standards

### Works With
- `re-listing-prep` — prep and photography inform which features to lead with
- `re-property-marketing` — social captions here feed into the broader
  marketing campaign workflow
- `re-cma` — pricing context informs where in the market narrative to position
  the property

## Example Prompts

- "Write BLC remarks for a 4BR/2.5BA in Fishers, $549K, updated kitchen, HSE"
- "Extended description for a Carmel luxury estate, 5,200 sqft, $1.1M"
- "Instagram and Facebook captions for a new Westfield listing launching Monday"
- "Fair housing check on these BLC remarks: [paste remarks]"
- "Write listing copy for a downtown Indy condo, urban lifestyle angle"
- "Relist copy for a property that expired — fresh language, same home"
