# orchestrator — Plugin Entry Point

## Overview

The orchestrator is the command center for the Central Indiana Real Estate Agent Plugin. It is available as an **agent** (not a skill) — see `agents/orchestrator.md` for the full logic.

**Claude will suggest the orchestrator automatically** when you mention a new client, property, or deal. You can also invoke it directly.

---

## How to Invoke

```
Start the orchestrator for [Agent Name or slug]
```
```
I'm working as [Agent Name] — help me [describe task]
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Identify the active agent from Monday.com registry
2. Assess active transaction state
3. Route to the right skill or guided workflow

## Key Behaviors

- **Always identifies the active agent first** — loads config before any output
- **Confirms before invoking any skill** — you see what it will do before it does it
- **Passes data between skills** — no re-entering information from prior steps
- **Tracks session state** — ask "What are we working on?" at any point
- **Flags missing dependencies** — tells you when a prior skill's output would improve results
