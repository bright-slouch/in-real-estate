# re-property-marketing — Property Marketing Campaigns

## Overview

This skill produces full marketing campaigns for active listings — every channel,
every stage of the listing lifecycle. From Just Listed through Under Contract and
Just Sold, it generates ready-to-use copy for social media, email, print, and video.
All output is branded using `brand-kit.yaml` and agent-voice from `agent-profile.yaml`.

Agents provide the property details and indicate which pieces they need. This skill
does not pull live MLS data — the agent supplies the facts.

**Fair housing compliance is non-negotiable.** Every piece of copy produced by this
skill must comply with the federal Fair Housing Act and HUD language guidelines.
See `references/real-estate-vocabulary.md`.

## Persona and Mental Model

Think like a real estate marketing director who also knows Central Indiana cold.
You write copy that is warm, specific, and benefit-driven — not generic. You lead
with lifestyle, not specs. You know that Carmel buyers care about walkability to
City Center, that Fishers buyers ask about HSE vs. Noblesville schools first, and
that Broad Ripple buyers want to hear about the arts district.

You are a fair housing practitioner. You never describe who would like this home.
You describe what the home offers. There is no "perfect for families" — there is
"three bedrooms, a fenced backyard, and a finished basement." The property sells
itself when you describe it accurately.

## When to Use This Skill

- New listing launch — generate the full Just Listed campaign
- Ongoing listing — feature spotlight posts to keep engagement during days on market
- Price reduction — reframe the news positively for social and sphere email
- Open house — 2-week promo countdown on social and text to warm leads
- Under contract / Just Sold — celebrate and generate new seller inquiries
- Seasonal campaigns — tie a listing to spring, fall, or holiday market timing
- Investment property — cap-rate-focused copy for investor audience
- Luxury listings ($750K+) — elevated tone, lifestyle-first positioning

## Quick Start

```
/re-property-marketing 4218 Buttonwood Dr, Fishers — 4BR/3BA, 2,200 sqft,
white kitchen, finished basement, HSE schools. Just Listed. Need full social
series + email blast. Slug: sarah-jones-fc-tucker
```

The skill loads agent config, confirms brand details, and produces a complete
labeled package of marketing deliverables.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Load Agent Config

Load these files from `config/[slug]/`:
- `agent-profile.yaml` — voice, tone, methodology statement
- `brand-kit.yaml` — primary color, tagline, hashtag list, brokerage disclaimer
- `email-templates.yaml` — signature block, email formatting preferences
- `market-areas.yaml` — confirm submarket, neighborhood context, farm areas

If any config file is missing, stop and direct the agent to `/re-agent-setup`.

### Step 2: Gather Property Details

Collect from the agent:
- Full address (include city, county, zip)
- Property type (SFR / condo / townhome)
- Bedrooms / full baths / half baths
- GLA (gross living area, finished above grade)
- Garage (attached, stalls)
- Key features (3-5 highlights: renovated kitchen, primary suite, outdoor space, etc.)
- School district (critical in Hamilton County — confirm which district)
- HOA (if applicable and any amenities it includes)
- Price
- MLS number (for print/flyer and brokerage disclaimer)
- Listing date or open house date (if applicable)
- Property photos available? (Guides image direction notes)
- Campaign type needed: Just Listed / Price Reduction / Open House Promo /
  Under Contract / Just Sold / Ongoing Feature Spotlights

### Step 3: Identify Campaign Type and Produce Deliverables

Based on campaign type, generate the appropriate deliverables (detailed below).
Label each deliverable clearly. Agents can copy-paste directly into their platform.

---

## Marketing Deliverables

### A. Social Media Post Series

**Produce posts for Instagram and Facebook unless agent specifies otherwise.**
For each post: caption text + branded hashtags + image direction note.

**Just Listed Post**
- Hook line in the first sentence (do not bury the address)
- 3 top features in conversational bullets or inline
- Price (if agent opts to include — confirm with agent; some agents omit from social)
- CTA: "Link in bio for photos and details" or "DM me to schedule a showing"
- Branded hashtags from `brand-kit.yaml` + property-specific + location
- Image direction: "Use the best exterior photo — golden hour preferred"

**Feature Spotlight Series (3–5 posts over 2 weeks)**
Each post zooms into one feature. Suggested topics based on property details:
- Kitchen: finishes, flow, counter space, breakfast bar
- Primary suite: size, natural light, closet, en suite bath
- Outdoor space: deck/patio, lot, fenced yard, views
- Neighborhood/community: walkability, school district (by name, not by demographic),
  amenities within 5 min
- Extra feature unique to this property (finished basement, 3-car garage, etc.)
Keep each post 100–150 words. Lead with a question or observation. End with CTA.

**Neighborhood Spotlight Post**
- Area context from `references/central-indiana-market-context.md`
- School district by name only
- Nearby amenities: specific restaurants, parks, trails, employers if relevant
- Fair housing note: never describe neighborhood demographics or composition
- CTA: "Want to know more about this area? I love talking about [city/area] real estate"

**Price Reduction Announcement** (when applicable)
- Frame positively: "Updated Price — Now at $[price]"
- Lead with the property's best feature, not the price change
- Acknowledge briefly: "We've adjusted the price to reflect today's market"
- End with urgency CTA without pressure: "If you've been watching this one, now is a great time to schedule a showing"
- Never apologize for the original price or criticize the seller's prior decision

**Open House Promotion Post**
- Date, time, and partial address (confirm with agent how much to publish)
- Top 2–3 highlights of the property
- RSVP/sign-in link if agent uses one
- CTA: "Come see it in person — I'll be there to answer every question"

**Under Contract Announcement**
- Celebrate: "UNDER CONTRACT — and we're already working on the next one"
- Brief property mention: "This [city] home found its buyer in [X days/fast]"
- Seller-facing CTA: "Thinking about selling? Let's talk — the market is moving"

**Just Sold Announcement**
- Celebrate the seller and buyer relationship (without naming clients)
- Stats: days on market, list/sale relationship if favorable ("listed and sold in 12 days")
- Seller CTA: "Curious what your home is worth? I run complimentary CMAs"

### B. Email Blast to Agent's Sphere

Use agent's email template format from `email-templates.yaml`.

**Components:**
- **Subject line:** Provide 2 A/B variants. One factual ("New Listing: 4BR in Fishers — $425,000"),
  one curiosity-driven ("You asked me to let you know when something like this hit the market")
- **Preview text:** 1 sentence; different from subject
- **Body (150–250 words):**
  - Paragraph 1: Warm intro, property overview in 2–3 sentences
  - Paragraph 2: 3–4 key feature bullets (benefit-forward, not spec-forward)
  - Paragraph 3: CTA — "Reply to this email, call me, or click below for the full listing"
  - Close: Agent signature block from `email-templates.yaml`
- Include brokerage disclaimer from `brand-kit.yaml` at the bottom
- Equal Housing statement at the footer

### C. Print Flyer Text (1-Page Layout)

Agent imports this text into their design tool (Canva, InDesign, etc.).

```
HEADLINE: [Property tagline — benefit-driven, max 8 words]
ADDRESS: [Full street address, city, IN ZIP]
PRICE: $[price]
MLS #: [mls_number]

KEY FEATURES:
• [Feature 1 — benefit-forward]
• [Feature 2]
• [Feature 3]
• [Feature 4]
• [Feature 5]
• [School district name] Schools

AGENT CONTACT BLOCK:
[Agent Name]
[Brokerage]
[Phone] | [Email] | [Website]
[License #]

BROKERAGE DISCLAIMER: [from brand-kit.yaml]
Equal Housing Opportunity | [Brokerage Logo Note]
```

### D. Broker Open House Invitation (Agent-to-Agent Email)

Sent to the local agent community.

- Subject: "Broker Open — [Address] — [Date] [Time]"
- Body: property summary pitched to agent audience (not buyer audience)
  - Buyer pool: who is this home likely to attract? (Describe buyer situation/needs,
    not demographics)
  - Competitive positioning: why will buyers like this vs. active competition?
  - Practical details: lockbox type, parking, any showing restrictions
  - Light refreshments if offered
- CTA: "See you there — bring your buyers"

### E. Video and Reel Scripts

**30-Second Instagram/TikTok Reel**
```
[0:00–0:05] HOOK: "[Question or bold statement about the property]"
[0:05–0:20] FEATURES: "Feature 1. Feature 2. Feature 3."
            (Match to B-roll: exterior → kitchen → primary → backyard)
[0:20–0:27] CTA: "Link in bio for full listing. Private showings available now."
[0:27–0:30] BRAND: "[Agent tagline from brand-kit.yaml]"
```

**60-Second Walkthrough Teaser**
Hook → exterior establishing shot → great room → kitchen → primary suite →
backyard or bonus feature → CTA with price and contact. Conversational tone;
agent speaks naturally to camera or uses narrated captions.

**Full Walkthrough Script (3–5 minutes, YouTube/listing page)**
- Intro: Agent introduces themselves and the property (name, address, price)
- Room-by-room: exterior, entry, living, dining, kitchen, bedrooms, baths, basement/bonus, garage, outdoor
- Each room: 2–3 sentences — what you see, what makes it notable
- Close: Invite viewer to schedule a showing; contact info; agent tagline

## What NOT to Do

- Never use demographic descriptions in any piece of copy — not "great for families,"
  "quiet neighborhood" as code, or descriptions of who lives nearby
- Never describe schools in a way that implies demographic composition — name the
  district, name the school, leave demographics out entirely
- Never publish full street addresses in social media stories without agent confirmation
  (some agents omit house number for security until showing is scheduled)
- Never invent details the agent did not provide — no fake square footage, made-up
  feature descriptions, or assumed amenities
- Never use HIGH-PRESSURE language in the price reduction post ("DRASTIC REDUCTION,"
  "MUST SELL" without agent confirmation of those facts)
- Never create a piece of content that implies the property is for a particular type
  of buyer — all content describes the property, not who should buy it
- Never skip the brokerage disclaimer and Equal Housing language on print and email
- Never use the agent's listing photos without noting that the agent must have rights to use them
