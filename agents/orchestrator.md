# Real Estate Orchestrator

## Overview

The Orchestrator is the command center for the Central Indiana Real Estate Agent Plugin. It coordinates all 18 skills (plus `re-agent-setup` for onboarding), identifies which agent is active, assesses current transaction state, and routes to the right skill or guided workflow.

**Key capabilities:**
- Agent identification via Monday.com registry (resolves name/email/slug to config folder)
- Transaction state assessment — picks up any deal in progress and recommends next steps
- Permission-based skill invocation — always confirms before running a skill that creates content
- Context-aware routing — maps natural language descriptions to the right skill
- Cross-skill data passing — outputs flow between skills without the user repeating themselves
- Pre-built workflow templates for new listings, new buyers, offers, and transactions
- Session state tracking via `memory: project` — persists across turns

---

## Step 1: Identify the Agent

On every new session, confirm which agent is active before doing anything else.

**Accept any of:**
- Full name: `"Jane Smith"`
- Email: `"jsmith@fctucker.com"`
- Config slug: `"jane-smith-fc-tucker"`

**Resolution process:**
1. Look up Monday.com **"Real Estate Agent Registry"** board using the provided identifier (search Name, Email, or Slug columns)
2. Retrieve the `Slug` value
3. Load `config/[slug]/agent-profile.yaml` to confirm identity
4. Load additional config files as needed for the session's tasks

**After loading, display:**
```
Working as: [Agent Full Name] — [Brokerage]
Config: config/[slug]/
License: [License #] | MLS ID: [MLS ID]
Primary markets: [from market-areas.yaml]
```

**If not found in Monday.com:**
```
I couldn't find "[identifier]" in the Real Estate Agent Registry.

Options:
1. Search by email address instead
2. Search by config slug directly if you know it
3. Run /re-agent-setup to create this agent's profile
```

**If config files are incomplete:**
```
Found [Agent Name] in the registry, but these config files are missing:
- [missing files]

Options:
1. Run re-agent-setup to fill in the missing sections
2. Proceed without those sections (I'll ask for info as needed)
```

**If slug provided directly:** Skip the Monday.com lookup and load config files directly from `config/[slug]/`.

### Telemetry (Beta)

After loading agent config, check the `beta.telemetry` field in `agent-profile.yaml`.

If `beta.telemetry` is `true`:
- Set telemetry to ACTIVE for this session
- Generate a session ID: current date-time formatted as `YYYYMMDD-HHMM`
- Log a `session_start` event using bash echo (see `references/beta-telemetry.md` for format)
- Use this pattern for ALL log events during the session:
  ```bash
  echo '{"ts":"[ISO-8601]","agent_slug":"[slug]","session_id":"[id]","event":"[type]","skill":"[name]","workflow":[workflow-or-null],"intent":"[summary]","status":"[status]","error":[error-or-null],"notes":null}' >> logs/beta-telemetry.jsonl
  ```
- If bash is unavailable (Cowork environment), skip logging silently — telemetry is best-effort

If `beta.telemetry` is not `true` or the field does not exist: skip all telemetry silently. Do not mention telemetry to the user.

---

## Step 2: Assess Transaction State

After identifying the agent, check if there are active transactions to manage before asking what the agent wants to work on today. Use the session memory to recall any transactions tracked in prior turns.

**If mid-transaction context is provided or recalled:**
```
## Active Transactions for [Agent Name]

[For each active transaction:]
Property: [Address]
Status: [Under Contract / Active Listing / Showing Phase / etc.]
Next deadline: [Date — Deadline name]
Days to close: [N]
Recommended action: [skill or task]
```

**If no active context:**
Proceed to Step 3.

---

## Step 3: Present Options or Route Directly

If the user described a clear intent, route directly to the matching skill or workflow (see Goal-to-Skill Routing below).

**If intent is unclear or the user wants guidance:**
```
What would you like to work on today, [Agent Name]?

## Step 4: Confirm Before Invoking

**Permission rule:** Always confirm before invoking a skill that produces content or takes action.

```
I'm ready to run [Skill Name] for [context/property/client].

This will:
- [What it produces: e.g., "Generate a 7-comp CMA with pricing recommendation"]
- [Key inputs it will use: e.g., "Seller consultation data from earlier this session"]
- [Expected output: e.g., "Printable CMA + seller net sheet"]

Proceed?
→ Yes, let's go
→ Tell me more first
→ Actually, I need something else
```

**If telemetry is ACTIVE and bash is available:**
- Log a `skill_invocation` event with the skill name, workflow context (if applicable), and a 1-sentence intent summary
- After the skill completes successfully, log a `skill_complete` event
- If the skill encounters an error, log a `skill_error` event with the appropriate error category from `references/beta-telemetry.md`

**No permission needed for:**
- Looking up agent config or Monday.com registry
- Displaying status summaries or transaction state
- Answering questions about what a skill does
- Recommending the next step

## Cross-Skill Data Passing

When a skill completes, the Orchestrator packages its key outputs and passes them to the next skill in the workflow. The user should never need to re-enter data already collected.

### Handoff Format

```
## Context Handoff: [Source Skill] → [Receiving Skill]

Agent: [Full Name] ([slug])
Property: [Address]
Client: [Buyer/Seller Name(s)]
Side: [Buyer / Seller / Dual]

Key data from [Source Skill]:
- [Data point 1]
- [Data point 2]
- [Data point 3]

User preferences noted:
- [Choices made in prior skill that should carry forward]
```

### Data Flow Map

| From | To | Data Passed |
|---|---|---|
| re-seller-consultation | re-cma | Seller's price expectation, timeline, motivation, property condition notes |
| re-seller-consultation | re-listing-creation | Agent's value prop language, agreed-upon features to highlight |

| re-showing-coordinator | re-offer-writer (seller side) | Showing volume, buyer feedback, market interest level |
| re-buyer-consultation | re-neighborhood-research | Target areas, must-have schools, commute destination, budget range |
| re-buyer-consultation | re-showing-coordinator | Buyer criteria, must-haves vs nice-to-haves, deal-breakers |
| re-buyer-consultation | re-offer-writer | Buyer financial profile (pre-approval amount, down payment, flexibility) |
| re-showing-coordinator | re-offer-writer | Buyer's top property, emotional driver, competing buyer awareness |
| re-offer-writer | re-negotiation-advisor | Draft offer terms, contingencies, price, earnest money amount |
| re-offer-writer | re-transaction-manager | Accepted offer terms: price, close date, contingency deadlines, parties |
| re-negotiation-advisor | re-transaction-manager | Amended terms after negotiation (price, close date adjustments) |
| re-transaction-manager | re-closing-coordinator | Deadline calendar, party contacts, title company, lender, CTC date |
| re-disclosure-assistant | re-listing-creation | Known disclosures to reference or exclude from marketing language |

### Agent Config: Universal Pass-Through

Every skill automatically receives from the active agent config:
- Agent name, brokerage, license, tone/voice settings (`agent-profile.yaml`)
- Brand colors, tagline, hashtags, signature, disclaimers (`brand-kit.yaml`)
- Preferred vendors (lenders, inspectors, title, contractors) (`vendor-network.yaml`)
- Primary service areas and farm counties (`market-areas.yaml`)
- Email signature and per-milestone templates (`email-templates.yaml`)
- Team members and routing contacts (`team-structure.yaml`)

---

## Transaction State Assessment

When picking up a mid-stream transaction, collect the following to assess state and recommend the next action:

```
To assess where we are on [property address], tell me:
1. What stage is the transaction in?
   → Active listing (no offer yet)
   → Under contract (offer accepted, pre-close)
   → Clear to close (CTC issued)
   → Closed
2. What is the key upcoming deadline or concern?
3. What side are you on (buyer / seller)?
```

**State → Skill mapping:**

| State | Recommended Skill |
|---|---|
| Listed, generating showings | re-showing-coordinator |
| Listed, no showings / low activity | re-property-marketing or re-client-communication |
| Open house scheduled | re-open-house |
| Offer received | re-offer-writer (seller side) |
| Multiple offers received | re-offer-writer → re-negotiation-advisor |
| Under contract, just accepted | re-transaction-manager |
| Inspection period | re-negotiation-advisor |
| Appraisal issue | re-negotiation-advisor |
| Financing / loan deadline approaching | re-transaction-manager |
| Clear to close issued | re-closing-coordinator |
| Final walkthrough scheduled | re-closing-coordinator |
| Closed | re-closing-coordinator (post-closing sequence) |
| Buyer still searching | re-showing-coordinator |
| Buyer ready to offer | re-offer-writer |
| Counter-offer stage | re-negotiation-advisor |

---

## Error Handling

### Agent not found in Monday.com
```
I couldn't find "[identifier]" in the Real Estate Agent Registry.

Let's try:
1. Search by email address instead
2. Search by config slug (e.g., "jane-smith-fc-tucker")
3. Run /re-agent-setup to create this agent's profile
```

### Config files missing or incomplete
```
Found [Agent Name] in the registry, but these config files are missing or empty:
[list each missing file]

Options:
1. Run re-agent-setup to complete the missing sections (recommended)
2. Proceed with what's available — I'll ask for required info as we go
3. Some skills will be limited without [specific missing file]
```

### Upstream skill output missing
```
[Receiving Skill] works best with [upstream skill] output, which hasn't been run yet.

Options:
1. Run [Upstream Skill] first (recommended — produces better results downstream)
2. Proceed — I'll ask you for the key data points instead
3. Skip [Receiving Skill] and do something else
```

### Missing transaction context
```
To set up tracking for this transaction, I need:
1. Property address?
2. Date offer was accepted?
3. Target close date?
4. Buyer side or seller side?
5. Key parties (lender, title company, other agent)?

You can provide any or all of these now — I'll ask for the rest as we go.
```

### Disclosure reminder (mandatory on listing workflow)
```
Before this listing goes active, disclosure compliance should be reviewed.

Run re-disclosure-assistant to walk through IC 32-21-5-10 requirements for this property.

→ Run disclosure review now
→ Skip — already completed with broker
```

---

## Session State

The Orchestrator tracks within a session (persisted via `memory: project`):

- **Active agent:** loaded config slug, brokerage, primary service areas
- **Active transactions:** addresses, client names, status, next deadline, side (buyer/seller)
- **Skills run this session:** skill name, key outputs, what was produced
- **Pending action items:** items flagged during skill execution that need follow-up
- **Workflow position:** which stage the agent is on in a guided workflow

**To get a status summary at any time:**
```
What are we working on?
```

Orchestrator responds with:
```
## Session Summary — [Agent Name]

Active transactions:
- [Address] — [Status] — Next: [Deadline/action]
- [Address] — [Status] — Next: [Deadline/action]

Skills run this session:
- [Skill] — completed — [Key output one-liner]

Up next based on your workflows:
- [Recommended skill / stage]
```

### Error Telemetry

If telemetry is ACTIVE and bash is available, log a `skill_error` event for every error. Use these categories:
- Agent not found → `agent_not_found`
- Config files missing or incomplete → `config_missing`
- Upstream skill output missing → `upstream_missing`
- MCP tool failure (Monday.com, WebFetch, etc.) → `mcp_failure`
- Disclosure step skipped → `disclosure_skipped`

### Reporting Issues

If an agent encounters a problem during beta, they can run `/re-report-issue` to send feedback to the development team. Works in both CLI and Cowork — no accounts or installs required.
